## What is Ransomware?

Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts your files and demands payment for the decryption key. It's one of the most devastating cyber threats facing individuals and organizations today, with attacks increasing by 41% in 2023 alone.

### How Ransomware Works

1. **Initial Infection**: Usually through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities
2. **File Encryption**: The malware encrypts files using strong encryption algorithms like AES-256
3. **Ransom Demand**: A message appears demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency)
4. **Payment Pressure**: Threats to delete files or increase ransom amount over time

## Types of Ransomware

### 1. Crypto Ransomware
- **Function**: Encrypts files and folders making them inaccessible
- **Most common type**: Accounts for 85% of all ransomware attacks
- **Examples**: WannaCry (2017), Locky, CryptoLocker, Ryuk
- **Target**: Personal files, documents, databases, images

### 2. Locker Ransomware
- **Function**: Locks you out of your device entirely
- **Approach**: Doesn't encrypt files but prevents system access
- **Examples**: Police-themed ransomware, Winlocker
- **Recovery**: Often easier to remove than crypto ransomware

### 3. Scareware
- **Function**: Fake security software claiming system infections
- **Method**: Claims to find issues requiring payment to fix
- **Impact**: Less harmful but still disruptive and costly
- **Examples**: Fake antivirus programs, system optimizers

### 4. Doxware/Leakware
- **Function**: Threatens to publish sensitive data publicly
- **Method**: Combines encryption with data theft (double extortion)
- **Growth**: Increased 935% in 2021
- **Examples**: Maze, Egregor, DoppelPaymer

### 5. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
- **Model**: Criminal business model offering ransomware tools
- **Access**: Lower barrier to entry for cybercriminals
- **Examples**: DarkSide, REvil, LockBit
